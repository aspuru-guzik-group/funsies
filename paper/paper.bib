	abstract = {Computational power and quantum chemical methods have improved immensely since computers were first applied to the study of reactivity, but the de novo prediction of chemical reactions has remained challenging. We show that complex reactions can be efficiently and autonomously predicted using chemical activation imposed by simple geometrical constraints. Our approach is demonstrated on realistic and challenging chemistry, such as a triple cyclization cascade involved in the total synthesis of a natural product and several oxidative addition reactions of complex drug-like molecules. Notably and in contrast with traditional hand-guided computational chemistry calculations, our method requires minimal human involvement and no prior knowledge of products or mechanisms. Imposed activation can be a transformational tool to screen for chemical reactivity and mechanisms as well as to study byproduct formation and decomposition.},

Most of the methods are quite efficient,           thanks to density fitting and multi-core parallelism. The program is a hybrid of C++ and           Python, and calculations may be run with very simple text files or using the Python {API},           facilitating post-processing and complex workflows; method developers also have access to           most of {PSI}4’s core functionalities via Python. Job specification may be passed           using The Molecular Sciences Software Institute ({MolSSI}) {QCSCHEMA} data format,           facilitating interoperability. A rewrite of our top-level computation driver, and           concomitant adoption of the {MolSSI} {QCARCHIVE} {INFRASTRUCTURE} project, makes the           latest version of {PSI}4 well suited to distributed computation of large numbers of           independent tasks.

In this regard, electronic structure packages have played a special role by using first-principle-driven methodologies to model complex chemical and materials processes. Over the past few decades, the rapid development of computing technologies and the tremendous increase in computational power have offered a unique chance to study complex transformations using sophisticated and predictive many-body techniques that describe correlated behavior of electrons in molecular and condensed phase systems at different levels of theory. In enabling these simulations, novel parallel algorithms have been able to take advantage of computational resources to address the polynomial scaling of electronic structure methods.

	abstract = {abinit is probably the first electronic-structure package to have been released under an open-source license about 20 years ago. It implements density functional theory, density-functional perturbation theory ({DFPT}), many-body perturbation theory ({GW} approximation and Bethe–Salpeter equation), and more specific or advanced formalisms, such as dynamical mean-field theory ({DMFT}) and the “temperature-dependent effective potential” approach for anharmonic effects. Relying on planewaves for the representation of wavefunctions, density, and other space-dependent quantities, with pseudopotentials or projector-augmented waves ({PAWs}), it is well suited for the study of periodic materials, although nanostructures and molecules can be treated with the supercell technique. The present article starts with a brief description of the project, a summary of the theories upon which abinit relies, and a list of the associated capabilities. It then focuses on selected capabilities that might not be present in the majority of electronic structure packages either among planewave codes or, in general, treatment of strongly correlated materials using {DMFT}; materials under finite electric fields; properties at nuclei (electric field gradient, Mössbauer shifts, and orbital magnetization); positron annihilation; Raman intensities and electro-optic effect; and {DFPT} calculations of response to strain perturbation (elastic constants and piezoelectricity), spatial dispersion (flexoelectricity), electronic mobility, temperature dependence of the gap, and spin-magnetic-field perturbation. The abinit {DFPT} implementation is very general, including systems with van der Waals interaction or with noncollinear magnetism. Community projects are also described: generation of pseudopotential and {PAW} datasets, high-throughput calculations (databases of phonon band structure, second-harmonic generation, and {GW} computations of bandgaps), and the library libpaw. abinit has strong links with many other software projects that are briefly mentioned.},

Proper behavior in the face of exceptional situations is important to the reliability of long-running programs. Existing programming language features often provide poor support for executing clean-up code and for restoring invariants. We present a data-flow analysis for finding a certain class of exception-handling defects: those related to a failure to release resources or to clean up properly along all paths. Many real-world programs violate such resource usage rules because of incorrect exception handling. Our flow-sensitive analysis keeps track of outstanding obligations along program paths and does a precise modeling of control flow in the presence of exceptions. Using it, we have found over 1,300 exception handling defects in over 5 million lines of Java code. Based on those defects we propose a programming language feature, the compensation stack, that keeps track of obligations at run time and ensures that they are discharged. We present a type system for compensation stacks that tracks collections of obligations. Finally, we present case studies to demonstrate that this feature is natural, efficient, and can improve reliability.},

Scientific applications require specific versions of compilers, {MPI}, and other dependency libraries, so using a single, standard software stack is infeasible. However, managing many configurations is difficult because the configuration space is combinatorial in size. We introduce Spack, a tool used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to manage this complexity. Spack provides a novel, recursive specification syntax to invoke parametric builds of packages and dependencies. It allows any number of builds to coexist on the same system, and it ensures that installed packages can find their dependencies, regardless of the environment. We show through real-world use cases that Spack supports diverse and demanding applications, bringing order to {HPC} software chaos.},

The authors of The Rust Programming Language, members of the Rust Core Team, share their knowledge and experience to show you how to take full advantage of Rust's features--from installation to creating robust and scalable programs. You'll begin with basics like creating functions, choosing data types, and binding variables and then move on to more advanced concepts, such as:  - Ownership and borrowing, lifetimes, and traits - Using Rust's memory safety guarantees to build fast, safe programs - Testing, error handling, and effective refactoring - Generics, smart pointers, multithreading, trait objects, and advanced pattern matching - Using Cargo, Rust's built-in package manager, to build, test, and document your code and manage dependencies - How best to use Rust's advanced compiler with compiler-led programming techniques You'll find plenty of code examples throughout the book, as well as three chapters dedicated to building complete projects to test your learning: a number guessing game, a Rust implementation of a command line tool, and a multithreaded server. New to this edition: An extended section on Rust macros, an expanded chapter on modules, and appendixes on Rust development tools and editions.},

	abstract = {Pro Git (Second Edition) is your fully-updated guide to Git and its usage in the modern world. Git has come a long way since it was first developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development. It has taken the open source world by storm since its inception in 2005, and this book teaches you how to use it like a pro. Effective and well-implemented version control is a necessity for successful web projects, whether large or small. With this book you’ll learn how to master the world of distributed version workflow, use the distributed features of Git to the full, and extend Git to meet your every need. Written by Git pros Scott Chacon and Ben Straub, Pro Git (Second Edition) builds on the hugely successful first edition, and is now fully updated for Git version 2.0, as well as including an indispensable chapter on {GitHub}. It’s the best book for all your Git needs.},

We are certain that {SLURM} will benefit both users and system architects by providing them with a simple, robust, and highly scalable parallel job execution environment for their cluster system.},

	abstract = {{SHA}-1 is a widely used 1995 {NIST} cryptographic hash function standard that was officially deprecated by {NIST} in 2011 due to fundamental security weaknesses demonstrated in various analyses and theoretical attacks.Despite its deprecation, {SHA}-1 remains widely used in 2017 for document and {TLS} certificate signatures, and also in many software such as the {GIT} versioning system for integrity and backup purposes.A key reason behind the reluctance of many industry players to replace {SHA}-1 with a safer alternative is the fact that finding an actual collision has seemed to be impractical for the past eleven years due to the high complexity and computational cost of the attack.In this paper, we demonstrate that {SHA}-1 collision attacks have finally become practical by providing the first known instance of a collision. Furthermore, the prefix of the colliding messages was carefully chosen so that they allow an attacker to forge two distinct {PDF} documents with the same {SHA}-1 hash that display different arbitrarily-chosen visual contents.We were able to find this collision by combining many special cryptanalytic techniques in complex ways and improving upon previous work. In total the computational effort spent is equivalent to 263.1263.12{\textasciicircum}\{63.1\} calls to {SHA}-1’s compression function, and took approximately 6 500 {CPU} years and 100 {GPU} years. While the computational power spent on this collision is larger than other public cryptanalytic computations, it is still more than 100 000 times faster than a brute force search.},
